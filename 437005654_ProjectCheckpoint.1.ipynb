        "1. The dataset is large, with over 750k training samples after cleaning, which makes large-scale modeling feasible without hitting memory limits.  \n",
        "2. Classes are reasonably balanced, with deviation under 4%, so we do not expect severe classifier bias.  \n",
        "3. Text data is noisy, informal, and user-generated, containing contractions and short titles, which suggests preprocessing and robust models are needed.  \n",
        "4. Vocabulary exhibits a strong long-tail distribution: a few tokens are extremely frequent while most appear rarely, making lexical space sparse.  \n",
        "5. Rare tokens carry important semantic information, so models that treat all words equally (like raw bag-of-words) may perform poorly.  \n",
        "6. Semantic overlap exists between categories, implying that embeddings capturing context will help distinguish closely related classes.  \n",

        "- The sparse and skewed vocabulary motivates using **contextual embeddings** rather than raw counts.  \n",
        "- Title-only and variable-length content suggest **transfer learning and fine-tuning** for stable performance.  \n",
        "- Semantic overlap and noisy user text make **transformer architectures** like BERT or RoBERTa suitable.  \n",
